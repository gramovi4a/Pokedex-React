# Pokedex-React üí•

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<p>A Pok√©dex is a catalog of Pok√©mon, that a trainer can browse to get detailed information about any Pok√©mon.</p>

### Requirements:

- Pok√©mon information is retrieved from Pok√©API (https://pokeapi.co/).
- The Pok√©dex must display a list of Pok√©mon and support simple pagination (e.g. ‚Äúnext‚Äù and ‚Äúprevious‚Äù buttons to get the next/previous page of Pok√©mon), such that not all Pok√©mon are displayed at the same time.
- When a user clicks on a specific Pok√©mon, additional information about that Pok√©mon must be displayed. E.g. type(s), stats, abiltities, height and weight.
- The application must contain multiple pages (e.g. "pokedex" and "about") and utilize React Router to route between them.
- The application must be developed using the Create React App toolchain.
